# GitHub Action Demo

This is a simple demo repository to showcase how to use GitHub Actions for automating your workflow.

## Introduction

GitHub Actions allows you to automate, customize, and execute your software development workflows directly in your GitHub repository.

In this demo, we will cover the following topics:
- Setting up a basic GitHub Action workflow.
- Triggering actions on specific events.
- Workflow customization.
- Viewing action execution logs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- A GitHub account.
- A GitHub repository where you have administrative access.

### Setting up a GitHub Action Workflow

1. **Fork this repository**: Click the "Fork" button in the upper right corner of this repository to create your own copy.

2. **Create a Workflow File**:
   - In your forked repository, navigate to the `.github/workflows` directory.
   - Create a new YAML file, e.g., `demo.yml`, to define your workflow.

3. **Define Your Workflow**:
   - Edit the `demo.yml` file to define the workflow using YAML syntax.
   - You can use the [GitHub Actions syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to configure various steps.

4. **Commit and Push**:
   - After configuring your workflow, commit the changes and push them to your repository.

5. **Workflow Execution**:
   - GitHub Actions will automatically pick up the workflow file and execute it based on the defined triggers.

## Workflow Examples

Here are some example workflows you can create:
- **Build and Test**: Automatically build and test your project on every push to the repository.
- **Deploy to Production**: Automatically deploy your application to a production server when you create a release.
- **Scheduled Tasks**: Run tasks on a schedule (e.g., daily backups, weekly reports).
